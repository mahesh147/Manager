# Manager

A React-Native app that allows a store manager to keep track his employees. The app uses Firebase Authentication to sign in the store owner. Each store owner's list of employees is kept in the Firebase Database. Redux is used to keep track of the various states in the app. 

The app allows the user to:
 - Create new employees
 - Update the employee's information
 - Message the employee's work schedule using the user's preferred messaging app.
 - Fire an employee, thereby deleting the employee's record in the database.

Clone or download the repo. Start the JS server and install the app-debug in your device or emulator.
